# documentation

This repository shall hold all the documents, media, notes, laboratory exercises, and other knowledge we, as an organization, have and can share publicly.

Due to the organization being formed recently, there's not that much quantity. On the other hand, quality is another thing, as we strive to deliver the best.

Feel free to browse the folders to search for things of interest. A table of contents or an index will be available in the future once there's more to come.

Recent laboratory: [Dual-boot Microsoft Windows and your Linux-based system with your UEFI keys](./labs/dualboot-win-and-lin-with-your-keys/README.md).
